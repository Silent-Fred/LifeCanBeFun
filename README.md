# Game of Life - No Conditionals 
#### _An aggressive attempt at avoiding all advice about anything..._ 

Conway's _Game of Life_, the classic problem to tackle in a code retreat, 
solved without the use of conditionals. 

The _Four Rules of simple Design_ almost apply: 

- The tests pass (or the test passes to be precise) 
- Code is fairly small, the number of classes could be hardly smaller, 
methods are short and not very numerous 
- Few repetitions 
- Naming is mostly comprehensible, although arguably that point will 
almost always lead to controversy

And yet... something seems strange. 

### A bonus

A tiny bonus for those who preach that code coverage alone would be a
metric for quality. The test has huge coverage - but no benefit at all.

### Why? 

Because after all, it is a fun solution.
